# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my Haskell solutions to the Advent of Code 2023
puzzles. You can find out more about Advent of Code at

## Build

Building this code should be trivial if you have Stack installed. The following
command should be sufficient to build the project:

```bash
$ stack build
```

## Run

Similarly, you can use `stack run` to run the project. The program takes two
arguments, which are the day number you wish to execute, and an input file. For
example, to run the solution for day 1, execute the following command:

```bash
$ stack run 1 input/Day01.txt
```
